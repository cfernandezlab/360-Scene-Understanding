# 360 Scene Understanding
Some tools to work with 360 images!

## Lines and Vanishing Points directly on Panoramas
Matlab implementation for lines and vanishing points extraction directly on panoramic images. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08294.pdf): 'Layouts from Panoramic Images with Geometry and Deep Learning' by Clara Fernandez-Labrador, Alejandro Perez-Yus, Gonzalo Lopez-Nicolas and Jos√© J. Guerrero.

In panoramas, a straight line in the world is projected as an arc segment on a great circle onto the sphere and thus it appears as a curved line segment in the image. For this reason, we represent each line by the normal vector of the 3D projective plane that includes the line itself and the camera center. 
We adopt the Manhattan World assumption whereby there exist three dominant orthogonal directions. Another particularity of this type of projection is that parallel lines in the world intersect in two antipodal VP whereas in conventional images they do in one single VP.
We detect lines and VP by a RANSAC-based algorithm that works directly with panoramas showing entire and unique line segments.

- To run the code:
```
main_linesVPs.m
```
Running time: ~ 3.8 seg/im with Matlab on Linux machine with an Intel Core 3.6 GHz (4 cores)
